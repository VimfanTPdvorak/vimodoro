1. Intro                                                      *vimodoro-intro*

Currently, this version of Vimodoro is solely dependent on the Vim-Airline
plugin. Once this plugin loaded and the Pomodoro state is inactive, it will
display current date and time in the `g:airline_section_y` statusline.

Vimodoro can also be integrated with RTM (Remember The Milk), a task management
application. This integration allows users to select a task from RTM's task list
to be started in a Pomodoro focus session. Once the task is marked as completed
in the Pomodoro session, it will also be marked as completed in RTM. This
seamless integration between the two applications enhances productivity and task
management efficiency.

2. Prerequisites                                      *vimodoro-prerequisites*
